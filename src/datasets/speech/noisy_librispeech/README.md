This dataset was created using the "train-clean-100" dataset from [Librispeech](http://www.openslr.org/12), plus the TUT acoustic scenes dataset. The dataset is used as follows:

- The training set is 25000 files, split into 2s samples, and randomly mixed with acoustic scene noise
- The test set is 3000 files, split into 2s samples, and randomly mixed with acoustic scene noise
